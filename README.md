# The Roost (Web)

This fun little project is a web application used to place orders to a fictitious brick & morter cafe named The Roost (based on the Animal Crossing franchise - which I love dearly). 

This project was simply a challenge to build an Angular application with a .NET 8 backend. Additionally, various Azure services are utilized for data storage, message queueing, and hosting. See below for the tech-stack breakdown.
